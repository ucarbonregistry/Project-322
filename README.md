PRIOR HISTORY

The project was uploaded for CDM prior consideration however, the project did not go ahead. The
PP i.e., CBKSSN has confirmed the same. Hence, as of now, the project is not under validation or is
not registered with CDM.

The project titled “28.7 MW Bundled Bagasse Based Cogen Plant is in Village Nanadi, Tehsil
Chikodi, District Belagavi, State Karnataka, Country INDIA.
Co-Generation (Cogen) Power Project is having two units, 20.7 MW and 8.0 MW. The first unit of 20.7
MW unit was successfully commissioned by Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited
(KPTCL) on 25/03/2004 and in operation from that date. The second unit of 8.0 MW was commissioned
KPTCL on 20/02/2020 and operational since that date. The Project is owned and operated by M/s
Chidanand Basaprabhu Kore Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane Niyamit Chikkodi. (Hereby to be called as
Project Proponent (PP))

The PP has set up an integrated new sugar mill of 5500 TCD capacity along with eco-friendly 20.7
MW capacity Cogen power project for decentralized generation of exportable surplus power, mainly
from renewable source of fuel (bagasse). The capacity of the sugar mill enhanced to 10,000 TCD in
the year 2020 and the Cogen power plant from 20.7 MW to 28.7 MW in the year 2020.
The integrated project comprises of a sugar mill for the manufacture of high-quality sugar and
ethanol. The by-product (bagasse) from the sugar mill is used in the Cogen power plant during
crushing season.
\
The Cogen power project of 28.7 MW capacity operates on bagasse for around 160 season days of
the sugar mill operation. At designed level, it is expected that the project will generate 11 million
kWh/y of clean energy and export about 54 million kWh/y through KPTCL grid for sale to KPTCL
or to third party consumer as per the prevailing tariff.

All the steam and power requirements of the sugar mill and Cogen power plant will be met internally
from the project itself. The project activity employs three boiler and two turbo-generators of the
following capacity along with all auxiliaries.

a. 1*150 TPH boiler with high pressure and temperature configuration (66kg/cm2
and
495°C),

b. 1*50 TPH boiler with medium pressure and temperature configuration (45kg/cm2
and
495°C)

c. 1*15 TPH boiler with low pressure and temperature configuration (10kg/cm2
and 180°C)

d. 1*20.7 MW Double extraction cum condensing Turbine Generator set, as well as ESP for
emission control and DCE control system for efficient operation.

e. 1*8 MW Double extraction cum condensing Turbine Generator set, as well as ESP for
emission control and DCE control system for efficient operation.

The power plant also includes the Balance of plants like, bagasse handling/feeding system, ash
handling system, compressed air system, cooling towers, electrical system and DCS control system
for efficient operation of the plant.

The project activity is the construction and operation of a Cogen power plant/unit that uses bagasse
as a renewable energy sources to generate electricity as well as steam and supplies electricity and
steam to the 10,000 TCD sugar mill and 30 KLPD ethanol plant.

The excess power is sold to KPTCL/third party through KPTCL grid. The project activity is thus the
displacement of electricity that would be provided to the grid by more-GHG-intensive means like
coal, oil and provides long-term benefits to the mitigation of climate change.
